                    <p>
                      Becoming a mom for the first time is one of those rare, blessed events that will forever change you—but just because it’s bound to be one of the greatest moments in your life doesn’t mean it’s going to be the easiest.
                    </p>
                    <img
                      src="img/blog/article01.jpg"
                      alt=""
                      class="img-fluid rounded-lg shadow-sm my-4"
                    />
                    <h5>Things may not go according to plan</h5>
                    <p>This can be a pretty soul-crushing realization for new moms. You spend all this time preparing, but as soon as your little one arrives everything goes right out the window. For me, I have a tendency to be a little obsessive. When my daughter was born, I equipped my husband with her recommended weekly feeding and sleeping schedule but my daughter had her own plans and ideas of what life would be like for her and so we had to align to her. Remember that just because you plan for your delivery to go a certain way, doesn’t necessarily guarantee it will. I had one obstetrician share with me that more than 80% of deliveries do not align with the intended birth plan.</p>
                    <h5>Bonding with Baby May Take Time</h5>
                    <p>We’ve all heard the stories about how the moment a child is born there is this heavenly euphoria that washes over the new mother…but that’s not always the case. Many new parents won’t feel that instant, heart-exploding connection for days, weeks and sometimes even months, and listen closely: THAT’S OK! When your five-week-old has spent the last four hours screaming at the top of his or her little lungs for no apparent reason, you might find yourself cursing that fresh-face new mama on Instagram who posted a gushing selfie about how much she’s enjoying every moment of motherhood (she probably had the audacity to have brushed her hair and put on lip gloss too). And the guilt you feel might even cause you to question “what’s wrong with me?” The answer? Nothing. That overwhelming, tear-inducing, can’t-live-without-you-love for your little person will come, I promise, but don’t panic if it’s not there right away. You’re in good company, I swear.</p>
                    <h5>Breastfeeding is Hard</h5>
                    <p>You’re going to hear a lot about the importance of breastfeeding—and you maybe be surprised at how passionate some people can be. While I had always planned to breastfeed my daughter, I wasn’t one of those diehard advocates. If it didn’t work for us, we’d switch to formula. My plan was to breastfeed for six months, and, when possible, begin to pump and freeze enough so that she’d be on breast milk her first year. I took the classes, bought the gear, and even invested in a deep freezer for storage. After two disastrous bouts of mastitis (an infection in the breast tissue) and weeks of wincing through feedings, my supply was next to depleted. The more stressed I became, the less I was able to produce. After two and a half months, I was done and absolutely devastated—and the deep freezer ended up being used for frozen meals (refer back to #1).
                      No one knows your journey, so no one should be passing judgment. If breastfeeding isn’t the best option for your family, that’s totally okay. You can still be a wonderful parent and have a happy, healthy baby if you choose to formula feed. And if you do decide to breastfeed, that’s great too and a wonderful way to bond with baby, but go easy on yourself. It’s often a bumpy start and for some moms can take real work. In the end, just do what you feel is best—and don’t let anyone make you feel bad about it.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-success">Decoding Baby's Cries</h2>
                    <p>Four years ago, just after the birth of our oldest daughter, I read somewhere that most mothers are able to tell what their babies want by the sound of their cries. I was awed -- and confounded -- as Phoebe's cries all sounded the same to me.</p>
                    <img
                      src="img/blog/article02.jpg"
                      alt=""
                      class="img-fluid rounded-lg shadow-sm my-4"
                    />
                    <p>Turns out I wasn't alone. In studies analyzing the acoustics of crying, even pediatric nurses could not determine the cause of a cry based on how it sounded. "It's a myth that you can tell what's wrong by the sound of the cry," says Harvey Karp, MD, a pediatrician in Los Angeles and author of The Happiest Baby on the Block. "Babies are like smoke alarms: You can't tell if you burnt the toast or if the whole house is burning down." Let’s look at some baby cry sounds and what they mean.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Is Baby Hungry?</h5>
                    <p><em>Sounds like:</em> Fairly desperate and unrelenting; usually high pitched.</p>
                    <p><em>Other clues:</em> She was breastfed more than an hour and a half to three hours ago or had a bottle two to four hours earlier. Baby roots around with mouth, wiggles, or gets frantic.</p>
                    <p><em>Solution:</em> When in doubt, assume your baby is crying because he's hungry and offer him the breast or a bottle. But if baby is bottle fed, baby may not be ready for more formula, says Deana Andersen-Tennant, a postpartum doula in Portland, Oregon, "If baby hasn't had at least two hours to digest the formula, giving more formula may cause unhappiness and discomfort."
                    </p><p>For breastfed babies, sometimes being held, but not fed, by Mom can be upsetting: Your baby can smell your milk. In this case, let Dad step in and hold the baby for a while. </p>
                    
                    <h5>Is Baby Tired?</h5>
                    <p><em>Sounds like:</em> Breathy, helpless. This cry can be intermittent and is more easily soothed than most others.</p>
                    <p><em>Other clues:</em> Baby's eyes are closed but baby is restless. Or, her eyes may be open and glassy, with redness or puffiness underneath them. Baby may rub her eyes.</p>
                    <p><em>Solution:</em> To help your baby sleep better at night, try swaddling her. Deana Andersen-Tennant, a postpartum doula in Portland, Oregon, has found that nine out of 10 babies are comforted by swaddling. (She recommends waffle-weave blankets to all her clients.) "Swaddling usually works like a charm with Whit when he's overtired," testifies Stacy Whitman, a writer in Hailey, Idaho, whose son is 9 months old. "The key is to swaddle nice and tight. I put the binky in first -- it helps him calm down so he doesn't 'fight' the swaddle."

                    </p><p>Also, if you are fairly convinced your baby is tired yet seems restless in your arms, put him down. "An overly tired baby sometimes just wants to be put down and allowed to sleep," says Andersen-Tennant.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Is Baby Bored or Overstimulated?</h5>
                    <p><em>Sounds like:</em> Usually not as loud as other cries and is often staccato. Boredom can easily transition to laughter; overstimulated can escalate to shrieking.</p>
                    <p><em>Other clues:</em> An overstimulated baby might turn his head away from you or other stimuli. He may angrily bat at an object.</p>
                    <p><em>Solution:</em> In the case of a bored baby, delay your response by a few seconds or a minute, recommends Marc Weissbluth, MD, a renowned in Chicago and author of Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child, who also wrote Your Fussy Baby. "In the first several weeks of life, you can't spoil your child or give him too much attention. But that doesn't mean you must respond promptly to every sound your child makes." During the delay, your baby may become engaged by the pattern on his crib bumpers or his hands in front of his face, thus eliminating the need for attention. Remind yourself you're not being cruel or unsympathetic, just laying the foundation for self-soothing.</p><p>To calm an amped-up baby, try white noise -- such as a noise machine, vacuum cleaner, or whirring fan. Carrie Barbaro Kane, of Evanston, Illinois, devised a different calming strategy: She runs warm water over the hands and feet of her 14-month-old son, Jameson.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-success">How do you balance work and a new baby?</h2>
                    <p>The first thing I will say is that you are definitely not alone! Practically every working parent feels this push-pull between career and family life. Some people might make it seem easy, but it’s not. It really does take a village, and every working parent I know has the help of a daycare provider, a nanny, the grandparents, or a spouse who is the primary caregiver. You’re not alone.</p>
                    <img
                      src="img/blog/article03.jpg"
                      alt=""
                      class="img-fluid rounded-lg shadow-sm my-4"
                    />
                    <p>My second piece of advice is to remove mommy guilt from the equation. Maybe you’ll find that as much as you love your little one, you actually enjoy some time spent with other grownups while you are at work. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Or maybe you’ve been career-driven your entire life, but once your baby is born you decide to quit your job to become a stay-at-home mom (if your finances allow it). That is 100 percent OK too. </p>
                    <p>As far as little tips and tricks go, it really helped to getting my baby sleeping through the night and on a really good schedule. That way our days feel predictable (for the most part). Even on days I am home with my baby, I know I will always have some time to get work done during naps and after bedtime. We sleep trained early on and it was a great decision for our family.</p>
